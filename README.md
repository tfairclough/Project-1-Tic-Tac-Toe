This is my first project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript as part of the SEI GeneralAssembly Course.

TicTacToe is a two player game. The rules are:

1. Players take turns to place tokens on a 3x3 grid.
2. The first player to complete a continous line of three of their token is the winner.
3. If all tiles are filled wihthout a complete line, the game ends in a draw.
