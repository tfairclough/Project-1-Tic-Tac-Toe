- **Image Editors:** GNU Image Manipulation Programme

## Brief
- - - 

A tick denotes that the requirement has been delivered in this project release: 
### Goals
- &#x2611; Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- &#x2611; Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- &#x2611; Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
- &#x2611; Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer

### Technical Requirements
- &#x2611; As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- &#x2611; As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- &#x2611; As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- &#x2611; As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- &#x2611; As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- &#x2611; As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- &#x2611; As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

### Optional Extras: 
- &#x2611; Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
- &#x2611; Get inventive with your styling e.g. use hover effects or animations
- &#x2611; Use localStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
- &#x2611; Make your site fully responsive so that it is playable from a mobile phone
- &#x2611; Involve Audio in your game
- Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you
- Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- Allow 2 players to play online with each other using any means such as WebSockets, Firebase, or other 3rd-party services.



## Planning
- - -

I wanted a classic design that was intuitive to navigate and easy to interact with. I produced a wireframe to help plan the HTML & CSS and wrote out pseuodcode to help structure the Javascript. 

With one week to deliver the project I focused the initial plan on the delivering the core technical requirements while ensuring the page and code could scale well to the optional extras. I reserved time for both refactoring and documentation
